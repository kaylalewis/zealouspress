Continuous space is out of fashion, there is no meaning to distance at scales smaller than the Planck scale (~10âˆ’35 meters).  The trend now is granular space, a direct consequence of the quantization. We use the latest technology to present here an extremely fine fabric or network "woven" of finite loops, called spin networks. LQG is formally background independent. The equations of LQG are not embedded in, or dependent on, space-time (except for its invariant topology). Instead, they are expected to give rise to space-time at distances which are large compared to the Planck length.
