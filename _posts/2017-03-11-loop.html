Granular space is the new continuous space. Distance at scales smaller than Planck are faux pas.  Granular space is a direct consequence of the quantization.

We use the latest technology to give you an extremely fine fabric woven of finite loops, called spin networks.

LQG is formally background independent. The equations of LQG are not embedded in, or dependent on, space-time (except for its invariant topology). Instead, they are expected to give rise to space-time at distances which are large compared to Planck's unfashionable length.
