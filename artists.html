<h2>What is Zealous Press?</h2>

<p>We are a small press focused on helping anyone tell their story. It starts with an idea, and ends with a product that captures the passion and vision behind the story. Topics vary, but the drive to create holds true across all of our projects.</p>

<p>Our team of artists, designers and writers see the potential behind collaboration. In fact, we often collaborate amongst ourselves. Including our own work in the Zealous collection gives us a forum to better understand our audiences and the processes behind publishing media. We also just love sharing the things we make!</p>

<p>At Zealous, we focus on print, and the outcome can be as lengthy as a novel or as bold as a billboard. Each project has its own identity and unique process. We love tackling new challenges, and outsource most final versions so we can use virtually any means to carry out our vision. Projects mean so much more when they reach the intended audience, and we work with you to create a distribution plan that accounts for the printing approach.</p>

<p>One day, we hope that everyone can share their story. Weâ€™ve got to start somewhere, and what better way than to start with you?</p>

<p>If you have an idea and want to share it with the world, come talk to us.</p>
