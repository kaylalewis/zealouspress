       <div>
         <p>I used to think that art was best created alone, void of the influence of others. It’s not the most intelligent thought. Most days, I engage with seas of people: through the internet, in person, on the phone. Making art while physically alone did not make me completely void of influence. I was taking influences and meditating on them by myself. That’s not a bad thing, but it’s sort of foolish to think that locking yourself away in a room lets you leave any associations with the outside world at the door.</p>

<p>Over time, my thinking has changed. Thanks to my day job as a designer, I’ve learned that working in waves of convergence and divergence with other people gives me the time to go off and do the alone, brooding thing, while also coming up for air to have a conversation with a real person here and there. These conversations illuminate more possibilities and things I overlook than I could ever imagine. Alone, I would never take projects in the direction they end up, which is a direction much more complicated and beautiful.</p>

<p>Now, you can’t just take what everyone says and change your art each time. You have to take in everything they say, and then sit down and let it soak in. You have to let it meld with your initial intentions, and the reason you chose to invest time, and presumably money, in the thing in the first place. Selectively choosing feedback to act on is a skill that comes with time, and it’s something I’ll work to master for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>The next level of involving people in your art is collaboration. I’ve had the best time working closely with other people when I make art. I learn so much about them. Often, they are my friends or peers. Making things for and with people is the most rewarding thing I will ever experience, and I’m lucky because I’ve gotten to experience it many times. I’m hooked.</p>

<p>I think that the art I make with my friends is the best art in the world. A lot of the time, we make it and smile and nod, and I set it in a corner somewhere in my apartment. Sometimes I’ll look at it and smile and nod again before folding it up and setting it back down. One day, I thought, ‘What if instead of letting this beautiful creation collect dust, I give it to other people who want them?’ Not to mention, my friends and I could all benefit from a little profit for our blood, sweat, and sketches.</p>

<p>So, I worked with my good friend Jordan, and we came up with our first project: Zealous Press. The branding and website embody the Zealous Press philosophy of making things with people, and the cool, weird things that come out of it.</p>

<p>This is just a start, and we have a lot to learn, but we’ve built an outlet for the things we make, to help promote those things and the people who make them.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that being comfortable with creativity makes people unafraid to push limits, because they know that new and fantastic possibilities await. In fact, it becomes addicting.</p>

<p>Welcome to Zealous Press.</p>
